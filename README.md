NAU CS399 Project 2 - The Theatre 

You run a small independent theatre (you may specialize in movies, drive-in movies, dinner theatre, plays, opera, music performances, or anything else you  might find at a “theatre”). Your task is to create a website for your business.

Your site should include:
* Location and Directions
* Upcoming Performances
* An information page for each performance
* Merchandise
* Ticket Sales
* Links to social media
